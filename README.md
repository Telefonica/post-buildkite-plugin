# Post buildkite plugin

A [Buildkite plugin](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/plugins) for
running pipeline **serial** steps conditionally when a step has succeed
or failed

The post section defines one or more additional steps that are run upon
the completion of a command. post can support any of of the following
post-condition blocks: `failure`, `success`. These condition blocks
allow the execution of serial steps inside each condition depending on the
completion status of the step.

## Example

The following pipeline will execute `annotate.sh`, wait for completion, and then `cleanup.sh` only when the command fails

```yml
steps:
  - command: test.sh
    plugins:
      jmendiara/post#1.0.0:
        post:
          - when: failure
            # steps is a string, note the `|`
            steps: |
              - command: email.sh
              - wait
              - command: clenaup.sh
          - when: success
            # steps is a string, note the `|`
            steps: |
              - command: slack.sh
```

## How it works

The plugin tracks the `command` exit code, and starts adding
one step at a time dinamically using `buildkite-agent pipeline upload`

When adding a pipeline dynamically, it's executed by buildkite
directly after the step that added it.
But when a `wait` is found after a failure in this situation,
the execution will be aborted.
The plugin transform the pipeline and uses this trick to add
steps one after another, making possible to have a serial
pipeline (with `wait`) after failures.

## Current limitations

- Only shell scripts can be commands managed by the plugin.

This **does not** work

```yml
steps:
  - command: |
      echo "test"
      test.sh
    plugins:
      jmendiara/post#1.0.0: ...
```

Use this instead

```yml
steps:
  - command: my_command.sh
    plugins:
      jmendiara/post#1.0.0: ...
```

- Parallel steps in the steps sections are not allowed when using waits

This **does not** work

```yml
steps:
  - command: test.sh
    plugins:
      jmendiara/post#1.0.0:
        post:
          - when: failure
            steps: |
              - command: annotate.sh
              - command: email.sh
              - wait
              - command: clenaup.sh
```

But are allowed when not using `wait`

This work

```yml
steps:
  - command: test.sh
    plugins:
      jmendiara/post#1.0.0:
        post:
          - when: failure
            steps: |
              - command: annotate.sh
              - command: email.sh
              - command: clenaup.sh
```

- Only `wait` and `command` are available as steps in the post section
